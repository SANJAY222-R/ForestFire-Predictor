# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The ProfileScreen was throwing a `TypeError: signOut is not a function` error when users tried to sign out.

## Root Cause
The `signOut` function was being imported from the wrong hook. The code was trying to get `signOut` from `useUser()` hook, but it should be imported from `useAuth()` hook.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Correct Hook Import**
- **Before**: `const { user, signOut, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useUser();`
- **After**: 
  ```javascript
  const { user, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useUser();
  const { signOut } = useAuth();
  ```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added proper error checking for the `signOut` function
- Implemented try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- Added fallback error handling when signOut is not available

### 3. **Loading States**
- Added `isLoggingOut` state to track sign-out process
- Implemented loading indicators during sign-out
- Disabled logout button during the sign-out process

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- Added confirmation dialog before signing out
- Implemented visual feedback during the sign-out process
- Added proper error messages for failed sign-out attempts

### 5. **Code Robustness**
- Added safety checks for function availability
- Improved error handling throughout the component
- Enhanced loading states for better UX

## Key Changes Made

### ProfileScreen.jsx
1. **Import Fix**: Added `useAuth` import and separated `signOut` from `useAuth()`
2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for sign-out process
3. **Loading States**: Added `isLoggingOut` state and visual feedback
4. **Safety Checks**: Added validation for `signOut` function availability
5. **UI Improvements**: Enhanced logout button with loading states

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Before (causing error)
const { user, signOut, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useUser();

// After (working correctly)
const { user, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useUser();
const { signOut } = useAuth();
```

## Testing Steps
1. Start the app
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to Profile screen
4. Click "Sign Out" button
5. Verify that you are signed out successfully
